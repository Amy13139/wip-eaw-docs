About
=====
ALA Files (May stand for Alamo Animation) are responsible for storing all animations for models in the game. They must
be coupled with an existing ALO. Animation names and triggers can be assigned from an
`XML File <basegame-chunked-ala>`, usually alongside the model.

ALA Structure
=============
All file format information can be found at `Petrolution Mod Tools <https://modtools.petrolution.net/docs/Formats>`_,
developed by Mike Lankamp. The website also contains several utilities for handling Alamo Engine files and a tool for
converting between ALA V1 files to ALA V2 files, which can be valuable if handling only one format is needed.

`Gaulker's Alamo Tools for Blender`_ is a utility to export ALO models and ALA files to and from Blender.
