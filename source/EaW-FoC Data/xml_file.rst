XML Files - EaW/FoC Data
========================

About
-----
XML files store large amounts of data for EaW. They contain most attributes of the game that are easily modded, such as unit information. The structure of XML is standardized, so please refer to the XML 1.0 Documentation for details about the format.

EaW XML Structure
-----------------

Special Files
_____________

EaW uses XMLs to store large amounts of their data, but not all XMLs are loaded. The 2 XML files that are always loaded are **megafiles.xml**, which specifies the .MEG files that the game should load, and **Dataminerxmlfiles.xml**, which indicates all other XML files to load and the type of data the file contains. These files are both crucial for separating used and unused assets for the game.
