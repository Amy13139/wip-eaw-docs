	*If you want to find something that isn't in the other XML types, it's here. It's all here. -luke13139*

.. note::

	Unlike the other XML types, this type has pages for it's possible top-level nodes. They are, on this wiki, separated into "categories" due to the massive overlap of subnodes and nodes.

The GameObjectType stores information related to anything the game considers and "object". This includes units, props, projectiles, particles, and heroes, to name a few.
